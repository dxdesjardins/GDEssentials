GDEssentials
=================
Custom event system and collection of tools for the Godot Game Engine. Many features attempt to reimplement functionality and popular repositories from Unity to Godot. This project's event system is designed to replace the need to use signal connections through the editor interface, eliminating reliance on breakable string references.

Features
----
1. A system for handling of GameEvents, GameActions, References and Variables notably allowing them to be created as Resources that can be dragged into subscribing Nodes. Various listener scripts working with this system are included.

2. Generic singleton class implementations for Nodes and Resources.

3. An object pooling system. See the GDPool repository for documentation.

4. A StageManager class implementing functionality of Unity's SceneManager. I define a stage as a highest level scene, such as a GameLevel or PersistentScene.

5. A collection of extension methods implementing functionality inspired by Unity.

Known Issues
----
This project may experience crashes due to an engine bug related to C# generic class compilation. It should fixed for the upcoming 4.3 release; I am currently using an unofficial engine patch to mitigate. Reference the issue report at:
